SSL Certificates for Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following three files must be present in the image ``/certs`` directory.  They can be obtained from
Mesos admins.

* mesos.crt
* mesos.key
* trustedroot.crt

Mount a volume at runtime as including them in a published image constitutes a security violation.

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run <flags> --volume=/home/user/certs:/certs usgseros/lcmap-spark <command>
